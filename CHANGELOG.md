## Changelog

## 1.1.0

Add `Swoosh.Email.Recipient` Protocl

The Recipient Protocol enables you to easily make your structs compatible
with Swoosh functions.

```elixir
defmodule MyUser do
  @derive {Swoosh.Email.Recipient, name: :name, address: :email}
  defstruct [:name, :email, :other_props]
end
```

Now you can directly pass `%MyUser{}` to `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, etc.
See `Swoosh.Email.Recipient` for more details.
